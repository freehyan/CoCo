# CoCo

**CoCo** uses the advanced features of **C++ 11** to achieve some engineering characteristics. Such as, reduce code duplication, avoid memory leaks, improve code quality, and make code simpler and more modern.

**CoCo** is a learning project, but which I will also share some c++ implementation of the algorithm projects.

#### IoC

IoC (Inversion of Control) through the configuration to eliminate the coupling of direct dependency of the object. By means of DI (Dependency Injection) injecting the object-dependent relationship into the target class constructor. IoC can create all types of objects and dependent objects.
